If creating a new team, ensure that you place the correct email into the box

Once you've selected or created a team, a series of regulations will show up on the screen, and you can either press the `Passed` button (if the car passes the regulation), the `Failed` button (if the car doesn't pass the regulation) or the `Not Applicable` butotn (e.g. if the regulation applies only to Cadet Class and the car is Senior Professional).

If a car fails a test, you have to add a comment as to why the car failed.

Once all the tests are complete, you can then send the owner of the car an email containing the results from the finish screen.
